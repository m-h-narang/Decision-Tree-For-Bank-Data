# Decision-Tree-For-Bank-Data
Decision Tree Classifier for Bank Marketing Data
This repository contains code for a Decision Tree Classifier designed to analyze a Bank Marketing dataset. The classifier predicts client subscriptions to term deposits, assisting the bank in identifying potential clients for long-term deposit accounts and targeting them through specialized campaigns.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The project begins with data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Model Development: A Decision Tree Classifier is developed using the entropy criterion to predict client subscriptions to term deposits.

Model Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an accuracy exceeding 70%.

Comparing Criteria: A second Decision Tree Classifier is built using the Gini index criterion, and its performance is compared with the entropy-based model.

Visualization: The decision tree is visualized using matplotlib, providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook decision_tree_classifier.ipynb to execute the project code.
Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the data, develop the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the decision tree.
